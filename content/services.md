I provide expert analysis in **geopolitics**, **disinformation**, and **strategic risk**, delivering actionable insights. By integrating advanced analytical techniques with deep multilingual and multicultural understanding, I offer clear, data-driven assessments. My services cater to governments, corporations, NGOs, and media organizations, helping them navigate an increasingly complex and uncertain world with confidence.

My **geopolitical analysis** helps clients anticipate risks, understand macro trends, and craft strategic responses to emerging challenges. I provide scenario forecasting, policy advisory, and in-depth analytical notes and situation reports on key regions, including France, Central & Eastern Europe, and Russia.  

In **disinformation and influence analysis**, I map media ecosystems, track real-time threats using OSINT techniques, and develop resilience strategies to counter hybrid threats. My **political risk and strategic monitoring** services offer thorough assessments using STEEPLE, PESTLE-M, and competitive analysis frameworks, ensuring clarity and confidence in decision-making.

For **communication and PR advisory**, I offer stakeholder mapping, crisis communication planning, and strategic messaging to strengthen influence and protect reputations.
